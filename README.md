# Calculator application.

This is the console calculator application to perform simple mathematical operations, such as :
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Division with reminder (%)

Also the validation of user input is implemented. There is class Validation.java with such methods, as :
- public Boolean isNumberCheck(String value) - checks whether the entered character is a number
- public Boolean isMathOperationCheck(String operator) - checks whether the entered character is a valid mathematical operation

### Limitations
You can execute only one operation at time.
